				<h4>The case for high rental prices in Lower Kabete</h4>
				<article>
					<p>A quick drive around Lower Kabete will reveal to you that prices for one- bedroom houses range around 25,000 while for Studios, it is around 15,000. I will only cite cases for one bedroom and studio because I am yet to live in a bigger house than the two.<br><br>

					I may not have good grounds for writing this piece, but I have observed one or two things that I would love to write. It is my belief that demand for good houses in Lower Kabete is high. I can explain that by pointing out a number of good houses built around that are filled to the brim with tenants barely leaving. To name just a few: Carina Apartments, Valley of Beracah, Bellwoods Studio, The Oaks and so many more. These good houses are mostly owned by developers who have been willing to pour their money into this project, because they have reasonable projection they will get return on that particular investment.<br><br>

					The law of demand and supply explains how if demand is high the supply rises to meet the demand and vice versa. High demand creates shortages, shortages drive prices high, this means more people will be willing to stake their resources to create the supply that is needed, cause the return is handsome. At the same time it means there is a lot of money chasing very few goods and services. In the case for Kabete people are willingly to pay handsomely as long your houses are neatly done especially in the interior. That is actually a phenomenon I have observed in most part of the country. We could as well say if you are offering people value for their money, they will pay it.<br><br>

					<strong>Prices drive demand, good price make supplies of commodity to increase</strong>, the good prices in Lower Kabete have allowed developers to stake millions in shillings to build houses and meet high demand with reasonable projection that they will get their return on investment. New houses continue to be built because demand for houses is high; Since the demand is yet to meet the supply the rent prices will continue to stay high as they are still a lot of money chasing the good houses. I am however predicting that in 10 years the prices will have to go down cause demand and supply may have even out by then. The reasoning behind it is, as investors continue to invest in houses due to incentive of getting good returns, those looking for houses will continue to occupy the new houses being built. Until it gets to a point there are so many houses that a lot of money chasing the houses will now being having options to chose the available. This is the point where demand has met supply, but investors will undoubtedly continue building and make the supply higher than demand forcing the prices down. Low prices discourage investors from investing in particular ventures.
