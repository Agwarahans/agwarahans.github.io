		<h3>My philosophy in life revolves around a hierarchy of values:  My apex value being industriousness, I believe that man has his own will and that his actions are responsible for quite a significant amount of things happen in his life. I believe one ought to work hard to achieve whatever he sets to do.</h3>

		<P>This is my effort to kill two birds with one stone. I am writing to empty my mind, but I am also practicing what I have learnt in web development, in other words I am trying to master the concepts of web development. As the famous internet sensation Naval puts it, 10,000 iterations not 10,000 hours.</P>

		<p>I don't know how many times i have mentioned my philosphy, my guess is probably a couple of times, but anyway I'll proceed by mention it again. My philosophy in life is to give your best at whatever you do and unforseen forces will come to aid you in your endeavours. Again, I know i have mentioned that somewhere up there but the holy mysterious book tells us to remind them even if they know. It is my thinking that man like Dostoevsky says in his book the underground man, is not a piano key that laws of nature willfully control. Man has his own free will, so his actions largely has ramifications on his life.</p>

			<h2>My philosophy is very pragmatic, and is not meant to make anyone feel good about themselves, but at least it gives you hope just like religion, that if you put your heart and soul into something it produces noteworthy results</h2>
		</div>

		<p>In my estimation a person is punish by his sins not for his sins. Sinning is something like missing a mark, targeting but not hitting the bull's eye. To hit the bull's eye, you need to sacrifice your today by preparing that tomorrow you will hit it. sacrificing is like bargaining with the future, doing what will make tomorrow more bearable. Often when you aim and miss and end up sinning, it is usually because your sacrifice like Cain's was not accepted; that your sacrifice wasn't good enough to help you hit the bull's eye. The important thing is to prepare again and this time make a better sacrifice and you will hit your aim.</p>

		<p> Perhaps I also need to remind you that you cannot hit the target without aiming, to aim is akin to asking, knocking and seeking, if you are to get somewhere you are therefore required to aim at it. Dear friend, don't sit their thinking some manna is going to drop from heaven, I advice not to spend alot of timing praying, for the student praying could be him studying smartly, for a farmer, his praying is tilling the land, weeding and watering it. It is my opinion that the function of prayer is not to influence the deity but to change the believer's mind. If you pray to be favoured to excel in your exams, if you are sincere it sets your consciousness in the mood of doing those things you need to do to excel, like sitting yourself down and studying. Sin can also be ommission not just commission, by omission I mean you fail to do what you know you need to do,technically called being willfully blind</p>
